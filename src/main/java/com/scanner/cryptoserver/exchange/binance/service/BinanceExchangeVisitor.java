    /**
     * When coins have duplicate symbols, such as "UNI", this visitor is used by services
     * to determine which coin is wanted for a given symbol that has multiple coins.
     * The coin wanted is the coin name, which is assumed to be unique. Thus, the coin
     * symbol/name pair should suffice for determining exactly which coin is wanted.
     * Since the exchange does not have the coin name in its API data, (only the symbol is there),
     * we simply must hard-code the values here, until the exchanges give more information in their
     * API data.
     * <p>
     * Also, some exchanges use different coin symbols than coin market cap. For example,
     * BQX on Binance is VGX on coin market cap. So, in order to fill in the market cap
     * for the BQX coin on Binance, we use this visitor to return the alternate symbol,
     * which will be used to get the market cap.
     *
     * @return the visitor to be used to determine the name of an ambiguous coin, or the
     * desired alternate symbol for a given coin.
